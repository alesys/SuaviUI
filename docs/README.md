# 🎮 SuaviUI

> *Because Blizzard's default UI looks like it was designed by a murloc having a bad day.*

## What is this?

SuaviUI is a World of Warcraft addon that makes your interface look **suave** (hence the name, genius 🧠). 

It's what happens when someone stares at the default WoW UI for 10,000 hours and finally snaps.

## Features ✨

- **Skinning** - We put makeup on Blizzard's frames. They needed it.
- **Action Bars** - Your buttons, but *fancier*
- **Unit Frames** - Health bars that don't look like they're from 2004
- **Castbar** - Know when your spell is done casting (revolutionary, I know)
- **Custom Trackers** - Track things. Customly. Is that a word? It is now.
- **Buff Borders** - Because naked buffs are inappropriate
- **M+ Timer** - So you can precisely see how badly you're timing the key
- **Tooltip Improvements** - More info, less mystery
- **And more!** - I got tired of listing features

## Requirements

- World of Warcraft: Retail (The War Within)
- A computer (probably)
- At least 2 brain cells to install an addon
- A burning desire to have a pretty UI

## Installation

1. Download this masterpiece
2. Extract to `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\`
3. Make sure the folder is named `SuaviUI` (not `SuaviUI-main` or `SuaviUI-master` - we've all been there)
4. Launch WoW
5. Marvel at your new beautiful UI
6. Forget how the default UI looked
7. Never go back

## Commands

```
/sui - Open the options panel (where the magic happens)
```

A: Maybe. Try it. Live dangerously.

**Q: The addon broke my game!**

**Q: Can I have feature X?**  
A: File an issue and we'll think about it while eating snacks.
