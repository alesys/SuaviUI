SuaviUI - Complete UI Customization Suite

**Description:**

What started as a joke in darkest corners of the Twisting Nether spiraled into a fully functional UI customization suite. Where legends once fell, SuaviUI rises—proof that even the most ridiculous ideas can become reality when channeled through forbidden code.

A Warlock sought the ultimate power: not to annihilate worlds, but to perceive them with perfect clarity. After binding a thousand demons and conquering countless dungeons, Suavicremas discovered the true enemy—cluttered interfaces and chaotic screens. He joked about channeling forbidden knowledge into lines of code. His friends laughed. Then he actually did it. The addon was born.

**What is SuaviUI?**

SuaviUI is a complete UI customization suite that gives you complete control over your World of Warcraft interface. It offers:

- **EditMode Integration**: Seamlessly customize every frame with WoW's native EditMode system
- **Customizable Unit Frames**: Fully tweakable player, target, party, and raid frames
- **Action Bar Customization**: Configure bars, buttons, and keybinds to your preference
- **Combat Enhancements**: Cooldown tracking, combat text, and real-time combat timers
- **Map & Minimap Customization**: Adjust scale, position, and transparency
- **Tooltip Customization**: Control what information appears and how

**Why SuaviUI?**

They say when you use SuaviUI, your reflexes sharpen, your awareness expands, and somewhere in the void, a demon whispers: "Smooth."

Whether you're pushing Mythic dungeons, dominating PvP arenas, or just tired of a messy UI, SuaviUI delivers the customization depth you need without the bloat you don't. Born from a joke that spiraled magnificently out of control—and we're not sorry about it.
